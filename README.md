## Learning to use Github with the hello-world tutorial

Hi. I've made websites off and on throughout my career. I've been involved in a couple of startups and have worn many different hats including marketing, strategic planning, branding, writing front-end code, database design, graphic design, etc. A lot of what I've done has been self-taught and much of it just enough to accomplish the task at hand. I've dabbled in Javascript, PHP, Actionscript, a little work in C and Java - the latter two were several years ago. I've also built sites from scratch and with CMS systems like Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress.

For the last few years when a web project has come up my go-to choice has been Wordpress, which has gotten the job done well, but hasn't really stretched my skills and has I think distracted me from learning some new approaches that have emerged.  I'm also working typically with small business owners where I end up doing the entire site: visual design, copywriting, brand messaging and web development, so I've rarely had the luxury of focusing on just one skillset.

Right now I'm tying to learn a few new things, maybe make a web app that isn't just a brochure site, or perhaps some projects that incorporate my artwork. It also seemed like high time that I learned to use things like git.

That's my story, such as it is. :)
